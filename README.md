# Fraud Detection Using XGBoost

## Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent financial transactions and provide business insights.

## Dataset
- 6.3M transactions
- Highly imbalanced dataset
- Columns include transaction type, amount, balances

Note: Dataset not uploaded due to large size.

## Approach
- Data cleaning & feature engineering
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Time-based train-test split
- XGBoost model for fraud detection

## Model Performance
- Precision (Fraud): 0.93
- Recall (Fraud): 0.89
- F1-score: 0.91

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Learnings
- Fraud detection requires imbalance-aware metrics
- Tree-based models do not require feature scaling
- Business understanding is critical in feature engineering
